    <h1>Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic land on opposite halves of Australian Open draw:</h1>
    <hr>

    <p class="bold">
        </br>
        </br> One of the big questions in the tennisphere going into the Australian Open has been whether Rafael Nadal
        and
        Novak Djokovic would be in the same half of the draw.
        </br>
        </br>Well, the draw is out, and the answer is no—the No. 1-seeded Nadal is at the very top of the draw, of
        course,
        while Djokovic, the No. 4 seed, is in the bottom half. So, they can’t meet until the final.
        </br>
        </br> But no matter where the two ATP legends fell in the draw, if history is anything to go by, chances are
        that one
        of them will be lifting the title in Melbourne at the end of the two weeks.
        </br>
        </br> This is the 60th time Nadal and Djokovic are both in the draw at a Grand Slam, and in the previous 59
        instances,
        one of them has gone on to capture the title 39 times (66%) and at least one of them has made it through to the
        final 47 times (80%).
        </br>
        </br> And recent history is more daunting for the rest of the field: the last 13 times Nadal and Djokovic have
        both
        been in the draw at a Grand Slam, one of them has gone on to win the title.

    </br>The last time both the Spaniard and the Serb were in the draw at a Grand Slam and neither one of them went on
    to
    win the title was the 2018 Australian Open, where Roger Federer won the title.
    Djokovic and Nadal could meet in a Grand Slam final for the 10th time at the Australian Open this year. Nadal
    leads across all majors, 5-4, but Djokovic leads in Melbourne, 2-0.

    </br> Djokovic and Nadal could meet in a Grand Slam final for the 10th time at the Australian Open this year. Nadal
    leads across all majors, 5-4, but Djokovic leads in Melbourne, 2-0.
    </br>
    </br> Neither Nadal nor Djokovic has an easy road in Melbourne, though.
    Nadal kicks off against No. 40-ranked Jack Draper, who was just five spots out of the seeds. The 21-year-old
    British lefty has recorded the first two Top 10 wins of his career over the last six months, defeating Stefanos
    Tsitsipas at the Masters 1000 event in Canada and Felix Auger-Aliassime at the US Open.
    </br>
    </br> The Spaniard’s projected seeded opponents would be No. 31 seed Yoshihito Nishioka in the third round, No. 16
    seed Frances Tiafoe (who beat him at the US Open) in the fourth round, No. 7 seed Daniil Medvedev in the
    quarters and No. 3 seed Tsitsipas in the semis.
    </br>
    </br> Djokovic opens against No. 75-ranked Spaniard Roberto Carballes Baena, with No. 27 seed Grigor Dimitrov
    lurking
    in the third round, No. 14 seed Pablo Carreno Busta fourth round, No. 5 seed Andrey Rublev in the quarters and
    No. 2 seed Casper Ruud in the semis.
    The two have played each other in Grand Slam finals nine times before—will they make it 10 in Melbourne this
    year?
