    <p>ANSWERS</p>
    </br>
    <p class="bold"></br>1st Round.<mark>2.</mark> Djokovic's most recent on-court setback at the Australian Open was a
        7-6 (4),
        7-5,
        7-6 (3) loss to
        Hyeon Chung. Bonus: It happened in the fourth round in 2018, when Djokovic was dealing with a painful right
        elbow; he would soon have surgery.
        </br>
        </br>2nd Round. <mark>1.</mark> Williams made her Grand Slam debut in 1998 and entered at least one major
        tournament
        every year
        until 2022, when she said she would be "evolving" away from her playing days after the U.S. Open. Federer's
        first major came in 1999 and he participated in at least two — but usually all four — every season until 2020,
        when he only appeared at the Australian Open before a series of knee operations that hastened the end of his
        career. He played in two more Slams in 2021, then announced his retirement last September. Bonus: In 2006,
        Williams made it to the third round at the Australian Open and fourth round at the U.S. Open, while sitting out
        the French Open and Wimbledon because of pain in her left knee.
        </br>
        </br>3rd Round. <mark>4.</mark> O'Neil won the 1978 Australian Open for her only Grand Slam singles trophy,
        defeating Betsy
        Nagelsen 6-3, 7-6 (3) in the final. O'Neil never made it past the second round on any other appearance at the
        Open — or past the third round at any other major tournament. Bonus: The most recent Australian man to win the
        singles championship at the Australian Open was Mark Edmondson, who beat countryman John Newcombe in four sets
        in the 1976 final.
        </br>
        </br>4th Round. <mark>2.</mark> Bonus: Graf led the WTA for 377 weeks. Djokovic holds the ATP mark of 373.
        </br>
        </br>Quarterfinals. <mark>1.</mark> Laver's first major trophy came in his home country in 1960 and he also won
        in
        Australia in
        1962 and 1969 as part of his two true Slams. Laver won Wimbledon four times and the French Open and U.S. Open
        twice apiece, for a total of 11 majors, but he missed out on a chance to add more during much of the 1960s
        because he turned professional before Grand Slam tournaments allowed pros to enter.
        </br>
        </br>Semifinals. <mark>3.</mark> All but one of the past 10 women's finalists at the Australian Open had never
        been
        there before.
        Bonus: The exception was Naomi Osaka, who was a first-timer in 2019, when she won the title, but of course was
        not when she returned to the championship match — and won it again — two years later.
        </br>
        </br>Women's Final. <mark>4.</mark> Since 2008, when Maria Sharapova won her Australian Open trophy, 10
        different
        players have
        been the last woman standing at the hard-court tournament that opens each Grand Slam season. Bonus: The other
        champs in that span were Serena Williams (2009, 2010, 2015, 2017), Kim Clijsters (2011), Victoria Azarenka
        (2012, 2013), Li Na (2014), Angelique Kerber (2016), Caroline Wozniacki (2018), Naomi Osaka (2019, 2021), Sofia
        Kenin (2020) and Ash Barty (2022).
        </br>
        </br>Men's Final. <mark>1.</mark> Only four men have managed to claim the championship at Melbourne Park over
        the
        past 1 1/2
        decades; indeed, that quartet's dominant streak extends to 2006, when Roger Federer earned the second of his
        total haul of six Australian Open titles. Bonus: Federer's other triumphs in the last 15 years were in 2007,
        2010, 2017 and 2018. The other men's trophies went to Djokovic (2008, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2016, 2019, 2020,
        2021), Stan Wawrinka (2014) and Rafael Nadal (2009, 2022).
